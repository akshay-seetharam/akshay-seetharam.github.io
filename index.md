## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/akshay-seetharam/akshay-seetharam.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This is the tentative website of Akshay Seetharam, who may use this to catalogue his work or personal projects. If not, that means he was lazy. The first thing that he will try to include is graphs of his Jeopardy! performance based on Coryats.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akshay-seetharam/akshay-seetharam.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
