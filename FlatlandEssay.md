# Supposing Subversive Shapes: Intersectionality and Geometry in *Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions*
In Edwin Abbott Abbott's 1884 novel, _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions,_ A Square, a two-dimensional Flatlander of the professional middle class, realizes that the world is much more complicated than he previously thought. Yet, the first half of the book deals primarily with a description of Flatland's societal structure and the rules that govern who can be loved and how much can and cannot ascend the social hierarchy. Thus, through the parable of A Square, Abbott encourages his audience to reconsider the rigidity of the class and gender system that was quintessentially Victorian England.

Before we get into interpretations of *Flatland*, we must first orient ourselves in the world of A Square and his companions. Flatland (not the book, the world) is a two-dimensional plane on which all "polygons" live. Just as A Square gives the readers (whom he addresses directly in second-person) some brief examples to illustrate the quotidian struggles of Flatlander life, I will direct you as to the key similarities and differences with our world. First, consider an equilateral on a table. When viewed from above, the triangle appears as it does to us in our world of three-dimensions; that is, we see the triangle in its entirety—including its interior. Let us now descend so our gaze lies just above the table at a very shallow angle. Though we still see the whole triangle, it has been foreshortened to such a degree that the ratio of its sides is entirely incorrect and appears drastically isosceles. Finally, let us descend so we view nearly parallel to the table and the triangle is almost a straight line from our perspective. Ultimately, the triangle appears as a straight line. This is how Flatlanders see each other—as one-dimensional objects. At this juncture, you may be tempted (as you should) to draw an analogy to our three-dimensional world. You might exclaim, "How can this make sense?! I see in three-dimensions, so Flatlanders must see in two!" I'm afraid you are mistaken. Inspect your field of view once more. Do you really see in three-dimensions? Think of a soccer ball—do you see its interior? No: you merely see its surface, which is technically a two-dimensional manifold; while it is embedded in three-dimensional space, it only looks to us as a projection onto our fundamentally two-dimensional field of view. Meanwhile, a four-dimensional being would see a three-dimensional view, meaning that they would be able to see our insides just as we can see a Flatlander's interior. Abbott also provides explanations for how Flatlanders identify each other and interact with their environment, but for the most part these are irrelevant to our discussion.

Now that we have explored the fundamentals of Flatlander life, we can begin to investigate the nuances of Flatlander society, which is primarily organized around the concept of "Configuration," the physical and implied moral regularity of a given shape. A Square informs, "As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a single maxim, 'Attend to your Configuration'" (Abbott 75). The capitalization of "Circles" and "Configuration" illustrates the importance of these concepts in Flatlander society and government. Specifically, "Configuration" is the central dogma of the organization and class system of Flatland. All are to aspire to possess perfectly configurations, with those at the highest levels of regularity conferred "Circle" status; even though they may really be hectogons, they are indistinguishable from Circles for the purposes of Flatland. Conversely, "All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most flagitious crime, \[a legendary king\] attributed to some deviation from perfect Regularity in the bodily figure," and more succinctly, "Configuration makes the man" (Abbott 75–76). By emphasizing Configuration as a division in society, Abbott can draw a parallel with the rigid structure of his own society—Victorian England. Furthermore, the use of such a generic word, "Configuration," forces the audience to question the most basic elements of their own society. There is an implicit rhetorical question directed at the reader: if the defining characteristics of Flatlanders could be so arbitrary, why not reject the structures of your own society as such?

Though we have seen the power of *Flatland* as a parable, it is not simply a passive text. Rather, it can be judged as an early indication of Modernist trends, which is most clearly seen through the second-person framing device. A Square begins his tale with an address "To the Inhabitants of Space in General... So the Citizens of that Celestial Region May aspire yet higher and higher To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE or EVEN SIX Dimensions Thereby contributing to the Enlargement of the IMAGINATION and... Development Among the Superior Races of Solid Humanity" (v). Right off the bat, Abbott discloses that A Square is entirely aware of his story. Therefore, we must perpetually entertain the question, "Why does A Square choose to tell us this?" For instance, on the theme of Configuration, A Square relates that not only is there a rigid class structure based on the number of sides of each polygon, but also that women are extremely thin rectangles, so much so that they appear as lines. Because of their extreme angles, women are the most dangerous shapes in *Flatland,* possessing the capabilities to turn themselves virtually invisible by rotating and skewering any opponent with ease. The fear of women is so great that it is codified that "No Female shall walk in any public place without continually keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death" (26). Abbott juxtaposes the horror of the death penalty with the almost Orwellian "Peace-cry" to emphasize the control exerted over women and the blatant misogyny pervading Flatlander society. At this stage, the reader may be tempted to disconnect themselves from *Flatland*, assuming a detached and somewhat bemused attitude towards the backwards Flatlanders with their kooky views on gender. But Abbott does not let us off so easily: A Square provides a few more humorous (at first) anecdotes about women in Flatland:
