# Polar Integration
This is my first time taking real-time notes in Obsidian. I hope it goes well.

## Review
We had specified that for some region $D$, $$\iint_D f(x, y)\,\text{d}x\,\text{d}y = \iint_D rf'(r, \theta)\,\text{d}r\,\text{d}\theta $$ where $f'(r,\theta) = f(x,y)$ using the traditional transformations of $x = r\cos(\theta)$ and $y = r\sin(\theta)$. Written more simply, this can be expressed as $\text{d}A = r\,\text{d}r\,\text{d}\theta$.
